# FullStackDev

I am going through a fullstack course right now, using this to store projects

Going through a course through Capital One Udemy called The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
Going to use this repo to store the projects from the course and enventually put smth together

## Project 1

This first project is very basic html, learning headers, gonna blow through this in a day
Learned about header elements, paragraph element, and void tags

The project was creating a very simple website with a brief movie list, visible in section_1/Project

## Project 2

Learning about lists, nesting indentation, anchors and images

The starter code is beginning to be more and more involved, I dont love this development but oh well
May have to find a way to start shipping stuff to my computer

This project is a birthday invite and can be found in section_2/Project, changed it to a halloween party invite

Most important thing from this section was learning about basic attributes and their syntax

## Project 3

Did not code along to this one, but was file paths, HTML boilerplate and imbedding images

Basic stuff I would say but the boilerplate stuff was super helpful and learned to host my website on github

Project was a resume/portfolio site, linking multiple pages together
I also created a base index.html file at the root to be able to host all my projects in this repo and then publish to github

Next up is css :devil emoji:

## Project 4

CSS stuff, first learned the 3 types on adding css, inline, internal, external

Then learned CSS selectors, class, id, element

## Project 5

More Css, learning about some text properties, and the box model

Box Model:

Padding -> goes between element and border
Border -> between padding and margin
Margin -> between the border and the next element and it's box model

## Project 6

Intermediate css, learning about selectors and positioning, as well as the cascading nature of the language
