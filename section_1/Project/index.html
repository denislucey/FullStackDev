<h3>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery</h3>
<p>I liked this movie, but not as much as I did the first time</p>
<h3>I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025)</h3>
<p>Somehow did not suspect who the killer was</p>
<h3>Honey Don't</h3>
<p>
    I really enjoyed this actually, the cast was loaded, and played really like a Western <br />
    Maybe took itself too seriously, and the ending was bleh
